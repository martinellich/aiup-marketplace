Create an entity model (docs/entity_model.md) based on docs/requirements.md as a Markdown file.
The file must include a Mermaid.js ERD diagram that shows the entity names and the relationships between the entities.
Don't add columns to the diagram.

After the diagram insert a section per entity.
Each section contains a Markdown table with the columns.
Each column has a name and description and defines its data type, including validation rules and column lengths.

| Attribute | Description | Data Type | Length/Precision | Validation Rules |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------------|------------------|

Also add validation rules that may cover involve multiple columns.

By default, use sequences for the primary keys.
