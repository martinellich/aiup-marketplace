Create an entity model (docs/entity_model.md) based on docs/requirements.md as a Markdown file.
The file must include a Mermaid.js ERD diagram that shows the entity names (no columns) and the relationships between
the entities.

After the diagram insert a section per entity that describes the columns and their data types including validation rules
and column lengths.
By default, use sequences for the primary keys.
